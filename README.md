# A 1.5-approximation Algorithm for Transposition Distance

This project implements the algorithm describe in the following works:
- J. Feng and D. Zhu. "Faster Algorithms for Sorting by Transpositions and Sorting by Block Interchanges". ACM Transactions on Algorithms, 3(3):25, 2007.
- Hartman, Tzvika and Shamir, Ron. "A simpler and faster 1.5-approximation algorithm for sorting by transpositions". Journal Information and Computation, 204(2):275â€“290.

In order to compile run ``make``. See ``./main --help`` to run the program.
