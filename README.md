# A 1.5-approximation Algorithm for Transposition Distance

This project implements the algorithm describe in the following work:
- J. Feng and D. Zhu. "Faster Algorithms for Sorting by Transpositions and Sorting by Block Interchanges". ACM Transactions on Algorithms, 3(3):25, 2007.

In order to compile run ``make``. See ``./main --help`` to run the program.
